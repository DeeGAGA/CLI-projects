## 🔥 Who Am I?

I'm DeeGAGA — a bold, all-rounded creative force breaking the lines between music, code, rhythm, and rebellion.  
By day, I’m a self-driven developer crafting command-line applications from scratch using Termux and raw hustle.  
By night? I’m dropping music, dancing like a problem, and making art that screams.

---

## 🧠 What I Know:

- 💎 Ruby (CLI Projects, logic, terminal input/output)
- 💾 Git & GitHub (version control like a G)
- 🧱 HTML (web structure basics)
- ⚙️ Termux power-user (mobile-based dev workflows)
- 🎛️ DIY problem solving (I've built a whole portfolio from a PHONE, come on now)

## 🚀 Featured Project: `Age Wizard`

> A fully functional Ruby CLI app that calculates your age, zodiac sign, birthday countdown, space age across planets, and even drops a joke on you — all while acting like it’s sentient. 😼

## 🎭 Side of Chaos: The Artist

Outside the terminal, I am a musician, dancer, and producer.  
With 2000+ unreleased tracks, stage performances, and a self-built home studio, I live on both the rhythm and logic axis.
